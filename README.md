# mylisp
This repository contains code for my implementation of Lisp parser and evaluator. It is far from finished, but I think I can make something out of it.

## Appreciation
This project wouldn't be possible without the help of professor Hans de Nivelle. His parser-generator tool Maphoon, as well some of the additional implementation and contribution to Lips's AST made this project less difficult.

## How to run
First build this project with `make` and then run:

```
./main <filename.lsp>
```

or start an interpreter

```
./main
```
